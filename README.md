# How To Web3 - Storage

Part of my How to Web3 series to make Web3 easy and understandable for the everyday user. This is about Storage.

## About this series

How to Web3 has one goal. Help the everyday user to understand Web3 and try it out in the most easiest way. No technical depth, no buzzwords. Just simple explanations to several topics in the Web3 space.

## Storage

This one is about storage and what is the difference to Web2 storage. The user can try it out by uploading a file directly to IPFS via Pinata.

### NOTE

The API Key that is currently used to upload to Pinata is limited to 1000 requests to prevent spams. I will most likely improve that in the future.
